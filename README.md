# üß™ AV Dataset Sanity Toolkit

This repository provides a modular, extensible toolkit for validating the **calibration, completeness, and visual fidelity** of large-scale autonomous driving datasets ‚Äî with current support for **Waymo Open Dataset** and **nuScenes**. It is designed to help **ML engineers** working on AV/ADAS pipelines ensure that their datasets are clean, calibrated, and ready for downstream use in tools like **FiftyOne**, **Omniverse**, **Cosmos**, or **NUREC**.

---

## üö¶ Why This Matters

In real-world AV data pipelines, even minor inconsistencies ‚Äî misaligned timestamps, broken sensor calibration, or missing sensor streams ‚Äî can invalidate training or render simulation unusable. This toolkit helps catch those issues early by:

- Verifying **sensor presence** and **temporal consistency**
- Visualizing **LIDAR-camera alignment**
- Surfacing **metadata integrity issues**
- Supporting future conversion to **ncore** or **cosmos** formats

---

## üîç What It Checks

This toolkit performs the following sanity checks and transformations:

- ‚úÖ **Metadata integrity**: Missing fields, malformed records, etc.
- üïì **Timestamp alignment**: Across all sensor modalities
- üìâ **Missing sensor streams**: Camera or LIDAR views missing from certain frames
- üåÄ **LIDAR to camera projection**: Verify calibration by overlaying PCD points onto camera frames
- üìÇ **Sensor playback inspection**: Frame-by-frame review of each sensor stream
- üîß **Label alignment** *(coming soon)*: Cross-checking annotation presence and temporal sync
- üîç **PCD alignment**: Verifying 3D consistency across frames and sensors

All validation is visualizable with **[FiftyOne](https://voxel51.com/fiftyone/)**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Pipeline Overview

```bash
1. Load TFRecords or nuScenes logs
2. Decode and extract:
    - Camera images
    - LIDAR point clouds
    - Calibration matrices
    - Ego poses
3. Convert to standard output formats (.jpg, .pcd, .fo3d)
4. Create grouped FiftyOne samples per frame
5. Run visual inspection + projection validation
```

| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data_sanity_waymo.ipynb`        | Validates Waymo dataset exports. Checks calibration, timestamps, sensor coverage, and LIDAR-to-camera projections using FiftyOne.              |
| `data_sanity_nuscenes.ipynb`     | Validates nuScenes data. Performs playback, sensor integrity, calibration checks, and grouping for visualization in FiftyOne.                  |
| `waymo-importer.ipynb`           | Converts Waymo TFRecords into structured `.jpg`, `.pcd`, and `.fo3d` outputs. Handles per-frame extraction and grouped sample creation.        |
| `load-nuscenes.py`               | Loads nuScenes data and prepares grouped samples for FiftyOne. Handles image + LIDAR sync, transform handling, and sensor completeness checks. |
| `fiftyone_to_ncore.py`           | Prototype script to convert a FiftyOne dataset into Nucleus Core (ncore) format. Supports Cosmos/NUREC ingestion pipeline compatibility.       |
| `nvidia_data_sanity_check.ipynb` | A unified demo notebook that applies all key sanity checks (timestamps, calibration, projections, playback) across both Waymo and nuScenes.    |


### Known issues

- fiftyone_to_ncore is still a work in progress. The template is there for going to fiftyone to ncore but this is several months old now
- Waymo open dataset pip package only works on Linux! To grab the dataset sample without going through the pain, get in on hugging face [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dgural/fo_waymo_sample) 
- Even if you go to linux, many waymo scripts are bugged when decoding and use `bytearray` instead of `bytes`. This will fix any potential error you see.
